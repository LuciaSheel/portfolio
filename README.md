# Personal Website

## Hi there 👋🏼 I'm Lucia. Welcome to my portfolio website!

The main purpose of this website is to showcase my evolving projects as a software development student. 

So far, it demonstrates my ability to use HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.

Please click on the project headings to check them out!

If you want to listen to a really good song while you browse the portfolio, please open the Chaka Khan project item in another tab. At the bottom of the page is an embedded media player. It has a little pause before it starts, so breathe in, breathe out, then enjoy!

Sharing my progress and showing my commitment to building a full tech stack encourages me to continue learning and growing.

Thanks for visiting!
