# Personal Website

## Hi there 👋🏼 I'm Lucia. Welcome to my portfolio website!

The main purpose of this website is to showcase my evolving projects as a software development student. 

So far, it demonstrates my ability to use HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.

The "Memory Game" and "Random Cats" project items are rough in terms of CSS, however, they are meant to simply showcase interactivity by using event handling, dynamic content updates, and error handling. They respond to button clicks, dynamically update displayed content, and provide real-time feedback based on API data. Please click on their headings to check them out!

If you want to listen to a really good song while you browse the portfolio, please open the Chaka Khan project item in another tab. At the bottom of the page is an embedded media player. It has a little pause before it starts, so breathe in, breathe out, then enjoy!

There are three specifically interactive bits for the portfolio itself:
1. Back-to-top button - The <code>window.onscroll</code> event listener monitors the user's scroll position. When the user scrolls down 300px or more, it makes the button visible, enabling interaction with the page's layout.
2. Smooth scroll on click - The <code>backToTopBtn.addEventListener("click",...)</code> listens for clicks on the button and smoooothly scrolls back to the top.
3. Form submission with validation - The <code>submitForm()</code> function is triggered when the user submits the form. It checks if all fields (Name, Email, Message) are filled in. If they aren't, it shows an error message. If they are, it shows a success message with the user's name. Try it! 

Sharing my progress and showing my commitment to building a full tech stack encourages me to continue learning and growing.

Thanks for visiting!
