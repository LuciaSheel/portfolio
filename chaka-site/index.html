    <h2 class="h2">My Favorite Video</h2>
    <p class="p">Chaka Khan's relatively limited number of music videos is largely due to the era in which she rose to fame. Much of her success came during the 1970s and early 1980s, before the widespread popularity of music videos, which exploded with the launch of MTV in 1981. By the time music videos became a dominant form of promotion, Khan was already an established artist with a loyal fanbase built primarily through live performances, radio play, and albums. Additionally, the funk and R&B genres in which she thrived were often less reliant on visual media than pop music, further contributing to the smaller number of videos in her discography. So, there aren't a lot of video representations of her gloriousness, however, there are a few. This one is:
